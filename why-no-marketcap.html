  <h1>Why Does This Token Have No Market Cap or Rank?</h1>

  <p>Some tokens on CoinGecko show no market cap or ranking. This is usually due to one of the following reasons:</p>

  <h2>1. No Circulating Supply Provided</h2>
  <p>CoinGecko requires a public circulating supply to calculate market cap. If the project hasn’t provided this, market cap and rank will be blank.</p>

  <h2>2. New or Illiquid Token</h2>
  <p>If the token is recently launched or trades on low-liquidity pools, CoinGecko may not list full metrics until more reliable data is available.</p>

  <h2>3. Missing or Incorrect Token Data</h2>
  <p>If contract details, logos, or metadata are missing or wrong, CoinGecko may disable full tracking until it’s corrected.</p>

  <h2>4. Wrapped, Derivative, or Inactive Asset</h2>
  <p>Some tokens represent staked assets or are inactive, and therefore don’t get a separate rank or market cap.</p>

  <h2>5. Under Review</h2>
  <p>CoinGecko may be manually reviewing the token for eligibility, especially if it's a recent listing or suspected spam.</p>

  <p>If you're a developer or token team, submit missing info through the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/request" target="_blank">CoinGecko Request Form</a>.</p>
